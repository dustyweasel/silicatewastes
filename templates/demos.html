  This has nothing to do with sinks or cad files.  Just some old game demos I worked on
  years ago.
  I recommend trying Release.zip.  Or if you want to see me playing with 3D graphics try
  demo2_5b.zip.  Or if you want to try the editor I created and actually built these demos with
  then try edit2_5b.zip.  Don't ask me how the editor works I don't even remember.  The interface
  is awful,
  I don't know what I was thinking.<br/><br/>JUST REMEMBER ARROW KEYS, ALT, CTRL, AND ALT-Q.
