  <p>1-<span style="color: {{ratecolors[0]}}">REMAKE</span>&nbsp&nbspThis cutout was so bad that
  it caused a remake.<br/><br/>
    2-<span style="color: {{ratecolors[1]}}">GOOD ENOUGH</span>&nbsp&nbspYou cut this sink and
    all you
    know is the job got installed
    and you never heard anything about it.<br/><br/>
    3-<span style="color: {{ratecolors[2]}}">PERFECT</span>&nbsp&nbspYou examined the CAD file
    and verified that the transitions between
    arcs and lines are smooth (tangent lines parallel at transitions).  After
    it was cut you checked the cutout to the sink with a tape measure and verified the
    overhang was the same across the entire countour.<br/><br/>
    <span class="attention">If you haven't cut it yet then click the LATER button but please
    write down the sink info and
    come back and rate it later.</span>

  <p><span class="attention">please rate the sink above to load your selected sink:<br/>

  Tip: Not every bad rating is valid.  If you know how to protect yourself
  from remakes then check out a poorly rated sink and rate it yourself.
