Sink dxf website the granite industy uses nationwide.  Online since May 31st, 2019:  www.silicatewastes.com

I had an old website that I cobbled together with cgi bash scripting but I never really knew bash scripting and I always felt like it was a mess.  It listed sink dxf files for download.  The templaters where I work used it to see if they had to bring a sink back to the shop to draw it in CAD or if we already had a drawing.  Eventually the granite industry started using it nationwide and some people sent me more drawings.  I kicked around the idea of making it so people could log in and rate drawings but I didn't know how until I learned Python/Flask in Launchcode's LC101.  I had to figure out how to set up a LAMP stack and all that on my own, though.

So then I made this website.  Now instead of crossing your fingers and hoping you don't lose a few hundred dollars due to a bad drawing maybe someone else already tried it and rated the drawing good or bad.  I've got 300 registered users since May 31st, 2019.

I suppose I need to pull the model code out and put it in a separate file from the contoller code.  Maybe I will someday.
