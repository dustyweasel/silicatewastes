Sink dxf website the granite industy uses nationwide.  Online since May 31st, 2019:  www.silicatewastes.com

I had an old low effort website that I cobbled together with cgi bash scripting but I never really knew bash scripting and I always felt like it was a mess.  It listed sink dxf files for download.  The templaters where I work used it to see if they had to lug a sink back to the shop to draw it in CAD or if we already had a drawing.  Eventually the granite industry started using it nationwide and some people sent me more drawings.  It climbed to the top of google's listings.  I kicked around the idea of making it so people could log in and rate drawings but I didn't know how until I learned Python/Flask in Launchcode's LC101.

So then I made this website.  Now instead of crossing your fingers and hoping you don't lose a few hundread dollars due to a bad drawing maybe someone else already tried it and rated the drawing good or bad.  I've got over 200 registered users since May 31st, 2019.  This new site doesn't show up much on google yet but we'll see.
